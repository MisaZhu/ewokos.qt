/*
 * One QPlatformScreen per EwokOS display.
 *
 * The geometry, refresh rate and pixel format all come from the window server
 * rather than from a mode list: xwin has no client-visible mode setting, the
 * server owns the scan-out, and x_screen_info() reports what it decided.  So
 * modes()/currentMode()/preferredMode() are left at the base implementation -
 * advertising a switchable mode list we cannot switch would only let Qt offer
 * a screen mode change that silently does nothing.
 *
 * physicalSize() and logicalDpi() are also left alone.  xwin publishes no
 * physical dimensions, and the base computes them from a 96 dpi assumption,
 * which is the honest answer here and the one every other framebuffer QPA
 * plugin gives.

       premultiplied and straight.  xwin's compositor blends a window surface
       with straight alpha (graph_blt_alpha), and EwokosWindow::repaintInto() is
       where the two are reconciled.  The scan-out this describes is opaque
       anyway: the alpha byte of a desktop pixel is always 0xff. */
