/*
 * QFreeTypeFontDatabase with EwokOS's font directory.
 *
 * The base class does the whole job already - it renders through the FreeType
 * engine that this build was configured against (-system-freetype) and
 * addTTFile() registers a font file by path.  What it cannot do is find them:
 * its populateFontDatabase() scans a single compiled-in directory (QT_QPA_FONTDIR
 * or the mkspec default), and neither is where EwokOS keeps fonts.  Everything
 * in this tree reads them from /usr/system/fonts - that is X_SYSTEM_PATH "/fonts"
 * in libx's own header - so that is what is scanned here.
 *
 * defaultFont() is the second half of the same story.  This plugin provides no
 * platform theme, so QGuiApplication takes its default font from the platform
 * font database (initFontUnlocked() in qguiapplication.cpp), and the base
 * answers "Helvetica" - which does not exist here and degrades to whichever
 * family the matcher happens to hit first.  xwin's theme already picks the UI
 * font; this override hands Qt the same one.
 *
 * Registration goes through ewokSfntPeek() first and only reaches the base
 * class's addTTFile() when the peek declines a file; see qewokosfontscan.h for
 * why, and registerScannedFont() for the two being kept in step.
