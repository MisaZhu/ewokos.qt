#
# Shared Qt definitions for projects/qt.  Included by the top-level Makefile,
# demo/Makefile and every apps/*/Makefile, so each of those builds standalone
# against the SDK - the same way nx11's demos build against
# $(SDK_DIR)/include/nx11 and $(SDK_DIR)/lib.
#
# The top-level Makefile's "sdk" target populates:
#
#   $(SDK_DIR)/include/qt5   the complete Qt header tree - public, private and
#                            qpa headers, the generated config headers, and
#                            the mkspec's qplatformdefs.h - with every syncqt
#                            forwarding header resolved to its real file (see
#                            install-headers.sh)
#   $(SDK_DIR)/lib           libQt5*.a / libqt*.a plus libewokosqpa.a
#   $(SDK_DIR)/qt5/bin       the moc/uic/rcc host tools
#
# Two flags here are load-bearing and easy to lose:
#
#   -D__EWOKOS__      qsystemdetection.h keys Q_OS_EWOKOS and Q_OS_UNIX off this
#                     macro, because a bare -elf toolchain predefines no OS macro
#                     of its own.  Without it Qt compiles as "unknown platform":
#                     Q_OS_UNIX goes away, qcore_unix_p.h stops declaring
#                     qt_safe_poll, and the QPA plugin fails on its first
#                     include.  Qt's own objects got it from the mkspec's
#                     EWOK_CXXFLAGS.
#
#   -DQT_NO_DEBUG     Qt was configured -release.  Q_ASSERT, the layout of a few
#                     private classes and the inline/non-inline split of several
#                     QtCore functions all differ between the two, so every
#                     consumer and libQt5*.a have to agree.
#
# (The third, -DQT_STATICPLUGIN, belongs only to the plugin's own objects and
# lives in the top-level Makefile - apps are the importer side and must NOT
# have it.)

# The generated moc_*.cpp/qrc_*.cpp are chain intermediates (header -> .cpp
# -> .o), and make deletes intermediates after use - which forces the whole
# moc+compile+link chain to rerun on the next build.  Each Makefile lists its
# own generated sources under .SECONDARY to keep them on disk.  Deliberately
# NOT the blanket ".SECONDARY:" - that marks every target secondary, and make
# treats secondary targets as intermediates: a missing binary whose source
# chain carries no newer timestamp is then silently "up to date" and never
# relinked ("Nothing to be done"), which is exactly the wrong behaviour for
# the final executables.

# qt5/QtXml/ is here for the class forwarders - <QDomDocument>, <QDomElement> -
# which is all an app ever spells.  The two versioned levels are skipped because
# nothing outside the Qt build itself includes <QtXml/private/...>: qdom_p.h and
# qxml_p.h are consumed by qdom.cpp and qxml.cpp, which are compiled inside
# qtbase-5.15, not here.  Adding them would be a path that can never be taken.
#
# QDom is in the shared list rather than simulide's own Makefile because it is
# a module of the SDK like the other three, and an app that wants <QDomDocument>
