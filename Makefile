#
# Qt 5.15 on EwokOS.  This Makefile does three things, in order:
#
#   sdk      install the complete Qt header tree, the static libraries and
#            the moc/uic/rcc host tools into $(SDK_DIR) - the same shape
#            nx11 uses ($(SDK_DIR)/include/<name> + $(SDK_DIR)/lib), see
#            qt.mk for the exact layout
#   plugin   build the "ewokos" QPA platform plugin against that SDK and
#            install libewokosqpa.a + <qt/ewokosqt.h> next to it
#   subs     recurse into demo/ and apps/*, each of which carries its own
#            standalone Makefile and links its executable against the SDK
#
# This builds against the tree projects/qt/build.sh produced - configure plus
# make in build/qtbuild-$(ARCH)-$(HW), with the sources in qtbase-5.15.
# Run build.sh first; nothing here can work without it.
#
# The plugin is deliberately NOT a qmake project.  qmake would want to run
# against an installed Qt (a qt5 .pri, a module list, a working qmake for the
# target), and the value of building it by hand is that it lives in this repo,
# under version control, next to the mkspec and the patches it depends on - so
# changing it does not mean re-running configure or touching qtbase-5.15,
# which is a vendored snapshot.
#
# The Qt compile/link flags shared with the apps (and the two load-bearing
# defines -D__EWOKOS__ / -DQT_NO_DEBUG) live in qt.mk.  One flag is local:
#
#   -DQT_STATICPLUGIN only for the plugin's own objects.  It is what makes
#                     QT_MOC_EXPORT_PLUGIN emit the static form -
#                     qt_static_plugin_EwokosIntegrationPlugin() - instead of
#                     the extern "C" dllexport form a shared plugin needs.  The
#                     apps must NOT have it: that is the QT_PLUGIN side of the
#                     distinction, and the app is the importer.

# Qt-tree probe, evaluated at parse time.  bin/moc is one of the first
# binaries a qtbase build produces, so it doubles as the "Qt is built" marker.
# When the tree for the current ARCH/HW is missing, `make` no longer skips: it
# bootstraps it by running build.sh and then re-invoking itself (see the
# QT_MISSING branch below).  A probe rather than $(error) so that `make clean`
# still works on a tree that has never built Qt.

# ---- SDK install ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Headers: both include trees are needed - syncqt wrote the forwarding headers
# (public, versioned private and qpa) into the source tree, the build tree
# only has the generated configuration headers.  install-headers.sh merges
# them into $(SDK_DIR)/include/qt5, resolving every forwarding header to its
# real file so the installed tree stands on its own.  The mkspec's
# qplatformdefs.h rides along because QtCore/private/qcore_unix_p.h includes
# it by bare name - and it in turn includes ../common/posix/qplatformdefs.h,
# which includes ../c89/qplatformdefs.h, so those two ride along at their
# relative places to keep every include resolvable inside the SDK.  A stamp
# file rather than 2000 copy targets: the tree is reinstalled as a whole
# whenever the Qt build is newer.
