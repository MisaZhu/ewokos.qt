# Configure and build the vendored Qt 5.15 tree for EwokOS.
#
# Output is build/qtbuild-$(ARCH)-$(HW)/, which is exactly what
# projects/qt/Makefile compiles the "ewokos" QPA plugin, qtdemo and apps/
# against: its QT_BUILD is $(CURDIR)/build/qtbuild-$(ARCH)-$(HW), and its probe
# for "is Qt there" is bin/moc in that directory.  If this script has not run
# yet for the current ARCH/HW, `make` at projects/qt detects the missing tree
# and runs this script automatically before continuing - so it is normally not
# something you have to invoke by hand (the flags below are for when you do).
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                  # syncqt + configure + make
#   ./build.sh -j 8             # same, overriding the job count
#   ./build.sh --configure      # stop after configure
#   ./build.sh --reconfigure    # ignore an existing configure and redo it
#   ./build.sh --clean          # remove the build tree first
#   ARCH=arm HW=raspix ./build.sh
#   EWOK_SDK=/some/other/sdk ./build.sh
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Four things this script has to do that configure will not do for us.
#
# 1. syncqt, and before configure rather than after.
#
#    configure runs syncqt only for a git checkout - configure:697 guards it
#    with `[ -e "$relpath/.git" ]`, and qtbase-5.15/ is a vendored snapshot with
#    no .git of its own.  Two consequences, both fatal if left alone:
#
#      - the forwarding headers are never written.  Every #include in this port
#        goes through one: <QtCore/qglobal.h>, the versioned private set
#        (QtCore/5.15.19/QtCore/private/...), and <qpa/qplatformwindow.h>.  The
#        QPA plugin includes all three kinds.
#      - configure:758 then tells the bootstrap qmake
#        `INC_PATH = $(SOURCE_PATH)/include`, i.e. it assumes the release
#        tarball's pre-synced include/ directory.  Ours is gitignored precisely
#        because syncqt regenerates it, so the path would not exist.
#
#    Full syncqt, not the `-minimal -module QtCore` form configure itself uses:
#    that one exists to satisfy the bootstrap and would leave QtGui, QtWidgets,
#    QtFontDatabaseSupport and the qpa/ private headers unsynced.
#
#    And with an explicit -outdir.  syncqt.pl's positional argument only locates
#    sync.profile; where the headers are *written* is $out_basedir, which it
#    initialises to getcwd() (syncqt.pl:77).  Run from projects/qt/ without
#    -outdir it silently syncs every module into projects/qt/include/, right
#    next to the repo's own include/qt/ewokosqt.h - 1300 generated files in a
#    version-controlled directory, with no error to say it happened.
#
# 2. The mkspec and the patches have to be present *inside* the Qt tree.
#
#    projects/qt/mkspecs/ewokos-g++ is the version-controlled original, but
#    qmake only looks in $$QT_SOURCE_TREE/mkspecs, so it is copied there.  The
#    copy matters to the Makefile too: it sets QT_MKSPEC to the in-tree path
#    because qplatformdefs.h there includes "../common/posix/qplatformdefs.h",
#    and only Qt's own mkspecs/ has a common/.  Both steps are idempotent - the
#    copy overwrites, and each patch is tested forwards and in reverse before
#    anything is written - so re-running this script on a configured tree is
#    safe.
#
# 3. CROSS_COMPILE as an environment variable, not a -device-option.
#
#    -device-option only exists for -device builds and configure rejects it
#    alongside -xplatform.  The mkspec covers this by reading the environment
#    (isEmpty(CROSS_COMPILE): CROSS_COMPILE = $$(CROSS_COMPILE)), which is why
#    this script exports it rather than passing it.  Same for EWOK_SDK, which
#    the mkspec turns into the only -I and -L Qt is built with; it is taken from
#    the environment so one mkspec serves virt, raspi5 and the arm machines.
#
# 4. A feature list, because auto-detection is not enough.
#
#    Most of what EwokOS lacks, configure finds out by itself: the library tests
#    for dl, X11, EGL, glib, icu and fontconfig simply fail to compile against
#    this SDK, and the features fall off.  The flags below are the ones where
#    detection is wrong or where the default is a module nobody here links:
#
#      -no-feature-process   the only one that is a hard build failure rather
#                            than a preference.  Its condition excludes winrt,
#                            uikit, integrity, vxworks and rtems - five OSes, and
#                            never the feature itself - so on EwokOS it comes out
#                            ON, which drags in io/forkfd_qt.cpp.  That needs C11
#                            <stdatomic.h>, waitid, SA_SIGINFO and CLD_EXITED,
#                            and the SDK has none of them (there is not even a
#                            stdatomic.h to include).  patches/0001 gates forkfd
#                            on qtConfig(process) so the two stay in step; this
#                            flag is the other half of that.  Nothing in the
#                            plugin, the demo or apps/ uses QProcess, and
#                            QDesktopServices::openUrl already has a ::system()
#                            fallback behind #if !QT_CONFIG(process).
#
#      -qt-zlib              the SDK ships zlib.h and libz.a, so the system test
#                            would pass and QtCore would link -lz.  The Makefile's
#                            QT_LIBS does not list it; it only reaches -lz
#                            incidentally through EWOK_LIB_GRAPH.  Bundling keeps
#                            Qt's link closure inside the archives it names.
#
#      --iconv=no            the SDK has no iconv.h, so this is belt to the
#                            detection's brace - but QStringConverter's iconv
#                            path is one that would otherwise be selected by a
#                            test that has never been run against this libc.
#
#      -no-feature-{network,sql,testlib,concurrent,printer}
#                            whole modules.  The plugin and the apps need
#                            Core, Gui and Widgets plus the platformsupport
#                            archives; these are build time and nothing else.
#                            Each is a real feature name, which is what the
#                            -no-feature- builtin validates against.
#
#      xml is deliberately NOT in that list, though it used to be.  QtXml is
#                            three .cpp files sitting on top of QtCore -
#                            dom/qdom.cpp, dom/qdomhelpers.cpp, sax/qxml.cpp -
#                            and apps/simulide reads and writes every .simu
#                            circuit through QDomDocument: 70 call sites across
#                            circuit.cpp, subcircuit.cpp, chip.cpp and
#                            componentselector.cpp.  Building the module is both
#                            cheaper and more faithful than rewriting those onto
#                            QXmlStreamReader.
#
#                            It costs the rest of the tree nothing.  QT_NO_XML
#                            appears nowhere in qtbase's sources - grep it - so
#                            switching the feature on changes no instruction in
#                            any existing QtCore/QtGui/QtWidgets object; the only
#                            C++-visible effect is that qconfig_p.h's
#                            QT_FEATURE_xml goes from -1 to 1 and a generated
#                            QtXml/qtxml-config.h appears.  (It does make make
#                            rebuild everything that includes qglobal_p.h, which
#                            is most of the tree - a one-off.)  And because the
#                            link is static and grouped, an app that never
#                            touches QDom pulls in none of libQt5Xml.a.
#
#      ... and dropping the flag is only half of it.  This snapshot's
#                            configure.json had its "subconfigs" pruned to
#                            corelib/gui/widgets; upstream 5.15.19 lists nine.
#                            "src/xml" has to be put back.  Two different
#                            configure.json files are involved and they do
#                            different jobs:
#
#                              the top-level "xml" feature is a privateFeature.
#                                It writes QT_FEATURE_xml into qconfig_p.h, and
#                                that is what src.pro:179's qtConfig(xml) reads to
#                                decide whether src/xml joins SUBDIRS.  Removing
#                                -no-feature-xml gets you this far, and this far
#                                only.
#                              src/xml/configure.json holds the "dom" feature, a
#                                publicFeature.  configure only walks a subconfig
#                                that "subconfigs" names - qtConfProcessOutput in
#                                mkspecs/features/qt_configure.prf is what writes
#                                build/src/<module>/qt<module>-config.h, and it is
#                                never reached for a module nobody listed.
#
#                            Leave it out and the failure is not "xml is off":
#                            src.pro has already put the module in SUBDIRS, so
#                            make enters src/xml, and qtxmlglobal.h:45 dies with
#                            "QtXml/qtxml-config.h: No such file or directory" on
#                            the first of the three compiles.  A configure-time
#                            omission that surfaces as a build error two
#                            directories away from its cause.
#
#      -no-{opengl,egl,eglfs,xcb,evdev,libinput,tslib,mtdev,linuxfb,kms,gbm,
#           vulkan,directfb,fontconfig,xkbcommon,openvg,angle}
#                            every windowing/input/GL backend but `minimal`,
#                            which the mkspec already names as
#                            QT_QPA_DEFAULT_PLATFORM.  The real backend is the
#                            ewokos plugin, built by the Makefile outside Qt.
#                            Note -no-linuxfb does not cost Qt5FbSupport:
#                            platformsupport.pro lists fbconvenience
#                            unconditionally, and qfbvthandler.cpp inside it is
#                            inert here (guarded on Q_OS_LINUX).
#
#      -qt-{libpng,libjpeg,harfbuzz,pcre,doubleconversion}
#                            bundled, so the archives are the ones the Makefile
#                            names - qtlibpng, qtlibjpeg, qtharfbuzz, qtpcre2.
#                            For harfbuzz and pcre2 the snapshot leaves no
#                            choice: the SDK ships neither.
#
#      -system-freetype      freetype is the exception, and not by preference.
#                            src/3rdparty/freetype is absent from this pruned
#                            snapshot, so -qt-freetype makes src.pro add a
#                            sub-3rdparty-freetype target whose .pro does not
#                            exist - "Cannot find file: .../freetype.pro", and
#                            make dies before gui is reached.  The SDK does ship
#                            libfreetype.a with ft2build.h and freetype/, which
#                            is what the tree was pruned for.  Nothing is lost:
#                            src.pro gates the bundled copy on
#                            !qtConfig(system-freetype) but gates fontdatabases
#                            on qtConfig(freetype), which stays true - and the
#                            plugin needs that, since its font database is
#                            QtFontDatabaseSupport's freetype one
#                            (<QtFontDatabaseSupport/private/qfreetypefontdatabase_p.h>).
#
#      -no-pch               the mkspec's own note: a PCH would have to be built
#                            with the same -nostdinc++/-fno-exceptions/-fno-rtti
#                            set and buys nothing on a one-off cross build.
#
# The spelling of the bundled-library flags is not a matter of taste.  configure's
# parser hands the *next* argument to string, addString and optionalString options
# and to nothing else - qtConfCommandline_enum, which is what zlib/libpng/pcre/
# iconv are, does `isEmpty(val): val = yes` and never looks at nextok.  So
# "-libpng qt" sets libpng to yes and then trips over the orphan "qt" as
# "Invalid command line parameter".  The two forms enum does accept are the
# (qt|system)- prefix, which the parser splits into opt and val itself, and
# --opt=value.
#
# Deliberately NOT passed:
#
#   -c++std          the mkspec pins every QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_CXX* to -std=c++14, so
#                    whatever level Qt asks for is the level it gets.  Passing
#                    -c++std would only restate that in a second place, and the
#                    two could drift.
#   -no-feature-dlopen / -library
#                    QMAKE_LIBS_DYNLOAD is empty in the mkspec, the SDK has no
#                    dlfcn.h and no libdl.a, so the test fails and `library`
#                    follows it.  qplugin.h has no QT_NO_LIBRARY guard, so
#                    QT_STATICPLUGIN - the form the plugin is built with - is
#                    unaffected either way.
#   -no-accessibility / -no-feature-desktopservices
#                    both are wanted: the Makefile links Qt5AccessibilitySupport,
#                    and QDesktopServices::openUrl stays available to the apps.
